# Quick-start Guide to QuickCW

## Setup
`QuickCW` relies on the following non-standard packages:
```
numba
h5py
enterprise
enterprise_extensions
```

Once these are installed `QuickCW` can be used without installation.

## Running QuickCW
The main analysis code can be found in `QuickCW.py`, which can be executed by running the wrapper function `runQuickMCMC.py`. 


It can also be useful to use `run_QuickCW.sh`, which adds an other layer of wrapper and can make it easier to run the analysis in the background.
