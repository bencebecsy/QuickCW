# Quick-start Guide to QuickCW

## Setup
`QuickCW` relies on the following non-standard packages:
```
numba
h5py
enterprise
enterprise_extensions
```

Once these are installed `QuickCW` can be used without installation. The main analysis code can be found in `QuickCW.py`, which can be executed by running the wrapper function `runQuickMCMC.py`.
